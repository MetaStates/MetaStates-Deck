Solution:

Our decentralised social marketplace platform is built on Ethereum and utilises AI-driven vector embedding technology to analyse user preferences and property attributes, generating personalised recommendations. With seamless integration with leading metaverse platforms, we aim to educate, demystify and revolutionise virtual property transactions, making investments into virtual real estate accessible to everyone while building an engaged global community. 

Marketplace:

The virtual real estate market is rapidly growing, driven by the increasing demand for virtual land in gaming, social experiences, fashion, and advances in VR technology. The metaverse market is projected to be worth over $1 trillion within the next couple of years. Our platform aims to capture a significant portion of the market by providing a go-to decentralised marketplace for digital goods, catering to the needs of a global audience.
