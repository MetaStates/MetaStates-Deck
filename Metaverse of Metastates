The MetaState Metaverse:

Incorporating a metaverse within MetaStates as a long term move has the potential to revolutionise the virtual real estate marketplace industry. Leveraging the immersive nature of a metaverse, we can attract a wider user base and unlock new revenue opportunities evolving from a virtual real estate marketplace to a multi-dimensional metaverse platform.

Additional revenue streams:

Transaction Fees: Charge a percentage-based fee on property sales and rentals to generate revenue.
Premium Listing Options: Offer enhanced visibility and features for property owners willing to pay for better exposure.
Virtual Item Sales: Facilitate the sale of virtual items associated with properties and earn revenue through commissions or listing fees.
Virtual Events and Sponsorships: Host virtual events, sell tickets, secure sponsorships, and monetize through virtual item sales.
Advertising and Partnerships: Collaborate with brands for targeted advertisements in the metaverse, generating revenue through partnerships.

With funding and a team of experienced engineers we can integrate the following features:

Virtual World Environment:

Implementation would involve building a robust 3D engine with advanced rendering techniques for realistic landscapes and architecture and use of high-performance graphics APIs, such as Vulkan for the optimal UX, including Ambisonics or HRTF, to create an immersive audio environment.

Property and Metaverse Showcase:

Creation of optimised 3D models and physics simulation to showcase properties with realistic interactions with visual appeal. Open standards like WebXR or OpenXR to ensure compatibility with various VR platforms.
Further implementing teleportation mechanics using position tracking and world scaling algorithms with metaverse-specific APIs or SDKs to establish seamless connections and transition between MetaStates and other platforms.

Consideration of Virtual Events and Social Interactions:

Development of customizable event spaces with modular components for flexible configurations which will integrate real-time communication protocols, such as WebRTC and adopt gesture recognition or hand tracking technologies for immersive interactions within virtual events. 

Community Building and Collaboration:

User profile systems with customizable avatars, allowing users to build their identities within the metaverse. Further utilising content creation tools, such as in-world building editors or scripting languages will empower users to contribute their creative content and facilitate a creative community.

AI Virtual Companion:

To foster a supportive relationship with users offering real-time assistance and guidance. This virtual companion, powered by open-source AI frameworks like OpenAI's GPT-3 or Hugging Face's Transformers, which will constantly learn and adapt to the userâ€™s preference to provide personalised recommendations and enhance user engagement within the metaverse. Continuously improving through user feedback, the AI virtual companion will create an immersive and interactive experience in the metaverse using python libraries such as NLTK and spaCy.
